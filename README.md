# Task-4
Implemented MySQL aggregate functions such as SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), and MAX() to calculate total sums, counts, averages, and highest values on numeric columns.

Used the GROUP BY clause to group data by one or more columns, enabling per-group aggregation of results.

Applied the HAVING clause to filter grouped results based on aggregate conditions, selecting only groups that meet specified criteria after aggregation.

Demonstrated counting distinct values within a column to find the number of unique categories using COUNT(DISTINCT).

Showed grouping by multiple columns for more detailed categorization and aggregation using GROUP BY with multiple columns.

Provided sample data and MySQL syntax SQL queries as practical examples for summarizing and analyzing business data.

Explained the difference between WHERE clause (which filters rows before grouping) and HAVING clause (which filters groups after aggregation).
